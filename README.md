Standard deviation is a statistical term that measures the amount of variability or dispersion around an average. Standard deviation is also a measure of volatility: using Numpy is easy to calculate it for each stock or sector into Index.
With SD, we could calculate the coefficient of variation (CV=standard deviation/mean). As a rule of thumb, a CV >= 1 indicates a relatively high variation, while a CV < 1 can be considered low. This means that distributions with a coefficient of variation higher than 1 are considered to be high variance whereas those with a CV lower than 1 are considered to be low variance.
